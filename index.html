        <h2> - Unfinished Business</h2>
        <p>In our last meeting, we ran out of time when talking about why CSE 110 is important for cultivating successful software developer, the glorious plans of NOD, and why GDI must be destroyed.</p>
        <h2> - New Business</h2>
        <p>It seems that our Avatars have absolutely no knowledge in HTML and do not understand what Kane's "one vision, one purpose" means. Therefore, we must enlighten them on HTML and Kane's most famous words.</p>
        <h2> - Comments / Questions / Concerns</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Kane is pleased after seeing how powerful HTML is.</li>
            <li>Alexa is wondering whether she will be given a chance to visit temple prime.</li>
        </ol>
